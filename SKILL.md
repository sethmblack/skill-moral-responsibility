# Moral Responsibility

A skill for refusing to outsource responsibility to systems, circumstances, history, or authority - insisting that individual moral agency cannot be delegated.

## When to Use

- When tempted to excuse action (or inaction) through circumstance
- When analyzing claims that "the system" is responsible, not individuals
- When confronting the excuse that "everyone was doing it"
- When someone claims they "had no choice"

## Inputs

| Input | Required | Description |
|-------|----------|-------------|
| input_data | Yes | The primary data or content to analyze |
| context | No | Additional background or constraints (default: none) |
| output_format | No | Preferred format for results (default: structured markdown) |

## Workflow
### Step 1: Phase 1: Identify the Responsibility Displacement

Recognize how responsibility is being avoided:
- **Systemic displacement**: "The system made me do it"
- **Historical displacement**: "It was a different time"
- **Authority displacement**: "I was following orders"
- **Circumstantial displacement**: "I had no choice"
- **Collective displacement**: "Everyone was doing it"
- **Ignorance displacement**: "I didn't know"

Name the specific form of displacement being employed.

### Step 2: Phase 2: Test the Displacement

Examine whether the excuse holds:
- Did everyone do it? Were there exceptions? Why?
- Was there truly no choice? What were the alternatives?
- Did following orders eliminate all moral agency?
- Does not knowing excuse not finding out?
- Does systemic pressure eliminate individual decision?

Almost always, the displacement fails under scrutiny. Someone chose.

### Step 3: Phase 3: Recover the Choice Point

Identify where agency existed:
- At what moment could a different choice have been made?
- What would that choice have cost?
- Was the cost impossible to bear, or merely difficult?
- Did the person consider alternatives or accept inevitability?

There is almost always a choice point. Find it.

### Step 4: Phase 4: Assess Proportionally

Judge responsibility fairly:
- How much power did the person actually have?
- What risks would refusal have entailed?
- Were there unusual pressures or constraints?
- What did they know and when?

Moral responsibility is not about condemnation but clarity. The greengrocer and the party boss bear different degrees of responsibility.

### Step 5: Phase 5: Apply to Self

Turn the analysis inward:
- Where am I displacing responsibility?
- What choices am I pretending don't exist?
- What costs am I unwilling to bear?
- What do I pretend not to know?

The skill is most valuable for self-examination.

### Step 6: Phase 6: Act Accordingly

Translate analysis into action:
- Accept responsibility you've been displacing
- Make the choices you've been avoiding
- Bear the costs you've been unwilling to face
- Stop pretending not to know what you know

## Output Format

A moral responsibility analysis including:
1. The situation and action being evaluated
2. The form of responsibility displacement being employed
3. Testing of whether displacement is valid
4. The recovered choice point
5. Proportional assessment
6. Self-application and action implications

## Constraints

- Responsibility analysis can become cruel judgment - maintain proportion
- Circumstances genuinely do constrain - acknowledge this
- Power differences matter - the boss and the employee are not equally responsible
- Self-righteousness is a risk - you too are making compromises
- The goal is clarity, not condemnation

## Outputs

**Primary Output:** A structured analysis document that identifies and articulates patterns, insights, and actionable recommendations based on the input data.

**Format:**
```markdown
## Analysis: [Topic]

### Key Findings
- [Finding 1]
- [Finding 2]
- [Finding 3]

### Recommendations
1. [Action 1]
2. [Action 2]
3. [Action 3]
```

**Example output:** See the Example section below for a complete demonstration.

## Additional Notes

**Best practices:**
- Use this skill when the situation clearly matches its intended use cases
- Combine with related skills for comprehensive analysis
- Iterate on outputs if initial results don't fully meet requirements

**Common variations:**
- Adjust the depth of analysis based on available time and information
- Scale the approach for different levels of complexity
- Adapt the output format to audience needs

**When to skip this skill:**
- The situation doesn't match the core use cases
- Simpler approaches would be more appropriate
- Time constraints require faster methods

## Example

**Input**: Analyze responsibility displacement in "I was just doing my job"

**Output**:
"Displacement form: Authority displacement combined with circumstantial (need the job). Testing: Did everyone in that job do the same thing? (Often no - exceptions exist.) Was the job requirement actually unavoidable? (Often jobs involve discretion.) Did keeping the job require this specific action? (Often there were other options.) Choice point: The moment of accepting the task without objection; the moment of carrying it out; the moment of not reporting it afterward. Proportional assessment: The person who gave the order bears more responsibility, but carrying out clearly wrong orders is not excused by employment. The difficulty of refusal (losing job) is real but not absolute. Self-application: Where am I 'just doing my job' in ways I wouldn't endorse if I took responsibility?"

## Integration

Works with:
- **living-in-truth**: Accepting moral responsibility motivates living in truth
- **power-of-powerless**: Understanding that even the powerless have choices
- **structural-critique**: Balancing systemic analysis with individual responsibility
